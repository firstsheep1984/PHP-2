You should include ALL elements you may include

with (?) question mark so you can discuss them with
the teacher.

About 5 tables for 2-people team project is usually good.

You will want to use some online or desktop tools to create the mockup, such as https://balsamiq.cloud/ or similar https://www.creativebloq.com/wireframes/top-wireframing-tools-11121302

MAXIMUM TOTAL ABOUT 4 PAGES !!!
