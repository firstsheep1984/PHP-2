Quiz 1 shoutbox
===============

Create new Netbeans PHP project called quiz1shoutbox.
You will need the following files in it:
- db.php - connection to database, session_start
- shout.php - main shout form
- user.php?user=Jerry - show only shouts from a particular user name
- styles.css - make the app look nicer

You are not allowed any additional files in your project.

Create database 'quiz1shout' with user 'quiz1shout' accessible from localhost. Autogenerate password and save it in db.php along with the rest of connection information.

Create table 'shouts' with the following columns:
- id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
- name VARCHAR(20) INDEX
- message VARCHAR(100)
- tsPosted TIMESTAMP default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP


db.php
------

This file is used by all other PHP files.
You must connect to database and die() in case of connection failure with appropriate message from the SQL server explainig the reason.

You should also activate PHP Sessions mechanism here so you don't have to do it in other files.


shout.php
---------

Consists of a 3-state form submitted via POST, followed by a list of last 10 shouts, from newest to oldest, followed by count of shouts done in current web browsing session, similar to the following ascii art.

Name: [_________________]
Message: [________________________]
[[Shout]]

* On 2017-11-04 12:59:45 Alabama shouted: Anyone?
* On 2017-11-04 12:33:17 Alabama shouted: I am here!
* On 2017-11-04 10:23:44 Jerry shouted: Hi everyone

You have shouted _2_ times from this browser session.



On form submission you will verify the following:
- name must be 2-20 characters long and consist only of uppercase, lowercase characters, numbers, spaces and underscores (use regexp)
- message must be 1-100 characters long

If name is correct it must be kept in the form (displayed again) so user doesn't have re-enter it every time.

On failed submission you must display (above the form) reasons for why submission failed.


On both successful or failed submission you still display all the rest: the form, the list of latest 10 shouts and the count of shouts done in current browsing session.

On successful submission you also increment current count of shouts in this web browser session.


user.php?user=Jerry
--------------------

Takes a URL parameter 'user', executes an SQL SELECT query to fetch all records where name matches 'user' value. If no records are found display "no records found", otherwise display ul/li list of shouts.
If 'user' parameter was not provided display an error message saying so.


Other notes
-----------

You are required to apply best PHP programming practices such as naming variables in self-documenting way, preventing SQL injection, handling SQL errors after every query, etc.

Your HTML should validate with w3validator without errors (warnings are allowed).


What to submit
--------------

Export your database and save in the main directory of your project.
ZIP-up directory of your project and upload the ZIP file.
