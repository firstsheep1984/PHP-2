DAY 06 HOMEWORK
===============

TASK 1: Start figuring out who will be your partner for the project.

Most important is who will be your project partner.
Find someone who you can work with, ideally within 15 percentage points of your own final grade for DotNet 2 course.

Your partner is more important at this point than the topic of your project.

NOTE: All teams will have 2 members exactly.


TASK 2:

Continue working on 'slimshop17' project.

By now you should have the following URLs implemented:
/register - 3 state form
/login - 3 state form with sessions setting
/logout

All your pages must use twig templates inheritance and CSS.

Implement the following URLs:

NOTE: all /admin URLs are accessible for authenticated users only

/admin/products/add - 3 state form to add new product (skip adding picture for now)

/admin/products/list - html table with products, each product has links to "edit" or "delete" URLs. On top, above the table "add product" link is visible.

/admin/products/edit/:id - 3 state form for editing a product with given id

/admin/products/delete/:id - page that asks for confirmation of a product before deleting it

/ - index page, user-friendly list of products, when a product is clicked it takes user to single-product view
