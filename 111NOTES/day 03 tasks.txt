TASK 2
======

Create a new PHP project in Netbeans named 'people17'.
Make sure to put it into c:\xampp\htdocs\ipd17\people17 directory

Create the following files in this project:
- db.php
- addperson.php
- list.php
- styles.css

Create user and database using PhpMyAdmin named 'people17'.
Edit db.php contents so that it starts session and connects to database as we've done before. Save generated password for 'people17' user to that file.

In database 'people17' create table 'people' with the following columns:
- id INT PK AI
- name VC(50)
- gpa FLOAT(3,2)
- isGraduate ENUM('true','false')
- gender ENUM('male','female','other')

Implement addperson.php to handle 3-state HTML form using POST with the following fields:

Name [___________]          (1-50 characters)
GPA  [___________]          (0 to 4.3)
Is graduate [x]             (checkbox)
Gender: (*) Male, ( )Female, ( ) Other
[[ Add person ]]

Make sure you verify the submitted values:
- name must be 1-50 characters long
- GPA must be 0 to 4.3
In case of an error display the error messages and redisplay the form, keep the valid values as they were entered by the user, including checkboxes and radio buttons selection.

Add appropriate styles.css and use them to center the page contents as we've done before.

Implement list.php to display a list of all records from 'people' table in the form of an HTML table. Also center the page's contents using CSS.
