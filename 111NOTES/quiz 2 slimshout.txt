QUIZ 2 - PHP - Slim/Twig/MeekroDB/Monolog/AJAX/jQuery/CSS

Create new PHP project in Netbeans, call it quiz2slimshout.
Rename index.php quiz2.php and point .htaccess to it.
Install the standard libraries using composer, create subdirectories logs, templates, cache.

Configure Apache to serve this project on a separate port, e.g. 8009.

Create user with database named 'quiz2slimshout17'.
Add the following tables:

users
- id INT PK AI
- username VC(20) UNIQUE [***]
- password VC(100)
- imagePath VC(200) UNIQUE [***]

shouts
- id INT PK AI
- authorId INT INDEX to setup Foreign Key to users.id
- message VC(100)

You will implement a web application that uses the following URLs:

/
/login
/logout
/register
/forbidden
/internalerror

/shouts/add
/shouts/list
/ajax/loadshouts and /ajax/loadshouts/by/:username - single handler

Detailed descriptions:

/ index page with a-href links to login / register / logout / shouts list

/login - standard 3-state for for login using session
/logout - standard logout
/register - standard register
 - username must be composed of 5-20 characters only uppercase or lowercase letters and digits and underscore. Must not exist in database yet.
 - password must be composed of 5-100 characters with at least one uppercase, one lowercase and one digit
 - image must be provided in one of jpg/gif/png formats, width and height must both be within 50 to 500 pixels range. Saved into 'uploads/' directory. [***]

/forbidden and /internalerror - standard pages
 
/shouts/add - 3 state form
 - only accessible for authenticated users
 - message must be 1-100 characters long, id is taken from session
 - on successful submission add record to shouts and provide user with link to /shouts/list
 - on failed submission display error message and re-display the form

/shouts/list
 - initially display list of all shouts in an html table, one of the columns must be user's avatar image, width set to 50 pixels. Column list: id of shout, author name, author avatar, message [***]
 - above the table provide link to /shouts/add with text "Add new shout"
 - above the table provide drop-down (combo box) with one empty entry and names of all users in it. When a name is selected you will re-load the content of the table using Ajax $...load() function to only display shouts coming from that one particular user. If empty drop-down entry is selected then load all shouts from all users.
 
/ajax/loadshouts and /ajax/loadshouts/by/:username - single handler
 - suggested PHP Slim handler:
 $app->get('/ajax/loadshouts(/by/:username)', function($username = "") use ($app, $log) { });
 - handler sends back to web browser content of html table with all shouts from a particular username or all shouts if no username was provided
 - NOTE: If you prefer to use :id instead of :username it is allowed

FINAL NOTES:
* You must use PHP Slim/Twig/MeekroDB/Monolog/AJAX/jQuery/CSS technologies as we have done in class
* You must apply best practices as we have practiced and explained in class
* Basic CSS is required to center the contents and make it look pleasant
* Master twig template is required as well.
