3 types of web virtual hosts:
1. Name-based - every website has a different DNS name
2. IP-based - one IP address for each one website
3. port-based - every website has a different port number (WE CHOOSE THIS ONE)


URLs handled by an e-commerce website slimshop17
/ - index - list of all products, with links to register/login
/register - 3-state form
/login - 3-state form
/logout
/products/:id - view single product with ability to add to cart

We will need CRUD functionality to manage products
/admin/products/list
/admin/products/add
/admin/products/edit/:id
/admin/products/delete/:id

Later we may add /cart implementation
